# Climaty

Another app with a beautiful UI that can be launched on both ios and android devices.
This app tells the user about the current temperature of the user's global location (after requesting access to user's location) along with a customized short message.
The user can also browse the weather of any other city simply by pressing the _city button_ on the top right of the page, then typing out the city's name within the searchbar.
To perform such tasks, I have used a REST API called "Open Weather Map"
